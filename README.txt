To run mnist, just install tensor, use Python 2.7, and run the script.

To run cifar10, clone down the example (tutorial) code for the cifar10 tutorial replace /tesnsorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10 with the contents of each directory (improved or basic).

Cifar takes ~30 minutes to train with a GTX 745. Mnist ~5 minutes.
